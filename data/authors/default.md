Detail Oriented Master's student, studying **Data Science** at **Freie Universität Berlin**, with a passion for engineering.

**<u>My Interests</u>**: Machine Learning, Explainable AI, Gen-AI, Deep Learning 

Currently, I am working as a **Working Student** in the field of **Software Development** at **Siemens AG**. I am working on conformance testing for the *IEC61850* standard.

Previously, I was a Working Student in the **Department of Veterniary Medicine** at **Ludwigs-Maximilian Universität, München**. Being a member of the 'Populations Genomic Group', I contributed to the creation of a pipeline for combined Linkage Disequilibrium and Linkage Analysis (cLDLA) helpful for gene-trait mapping. I also worked on a phylogeny project for outlier detection in a given popluation.

Prior to that, as a part of my Bachelor's Thesis, I helped developed a honeypot for a cybersecurity NGO. I also helped them set up a 'Security Operations Centre (SOC)' for realtime Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) detection using open-source tools such as Wazuh, Coretex, MISP, and the Hive. Additionally, I also worked on Apache Struts RCE and log4j vulnerability scanners.

I am also honored to be the reciever of the **Deutschlandstipendium** 2023 :)

Outside of work, I like to enjoy a peaceful evening by the water, trekking, and cooking.
